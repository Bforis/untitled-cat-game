# untitled-cat-game
A relaxing, unfinished mobile game, built with Unity. Not testable.

This mobile game is not testable because the sprites are not included in the source code, but I can share some ideas about it.

The game is supposed to be relaxing. You have two perspectives: your house and a street.

In the street, you can see flocks of cats passing by, and you can try to lure them and adopt them if you have enough resources to solve a mini-game.

You can then find your adopted cats at home and show them love by petting them.

It's a very basic idea, but it involves many interesting aspects of how to build a game with such a simple concept. Although gameplay elements are missing to make it more appealing, that's one of the reasons why the game was not completed, maybe someday.
